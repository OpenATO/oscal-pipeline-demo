# Case Study: Shifting Left the Right Way with OSCAL

This repository was created to demonstrate an automated assessment workflow using GitHub Actions.  It utilizes a minimal application to trace a single control through the OSCAL models.

Detailed information about the use and structure of this repository can be found in the [docs/](docs/) folder.

Through this project, we intend to help take the first steps with OSCAL and integrate these concepts into a development project. This will facilitate security, privacy and compliance activities as a part of an application development project from the start.
